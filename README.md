## Introduction
The code provided predicts the Education Level of the winners of the Indian State Elections based on various features such as Total Assets, Liabilities, Constituency Type, and Extra Information about the candidates. The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided in the files "train.csv" and "test.csv" respectively.

## Code
The code is written in Python and utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms. The main steps of the code include:
1. Pre-processing of Training Data
2. Training the Model (using the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm)
3. Pre-processing of Test Data
4. Making Predictions
5. Plotting the Data (for visual analysis)

## Usage
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the Python script "CS253_Machine_learning.py".
